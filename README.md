# DungeonReset

A Torchlight 2 mod to make dungeons always reset.

When you take the portal at the end of each dungeon you can just re-enter the dungeon for a fresh new run.  All the mobs and bosses will be there respawned and ready to go.

This mod is a fork of the [BossReset](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=923993569) mod, which would only reset the boss and not the entire dungeon.
