# DungeonReset

A Torchlight 2 mod to make dungeons always reset.

By default the game will remember floors of dungeons that you've already cleared, so revisiting the dungeon won't have any monsters anymore.  This mod constantly resets dungeons so you can run them over and over again.

This mod is a must have for farming dungeon bosses, making it very easy to quickly aquire an armory of unique items.

## Credits

This mod is a fork of the [BossReset](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=923993569) mod, which would only reset the boss and not the entire dungeon.

## Notes

I've included is a secondary version of this mod for use w/ the essential [UnearthedArcana](https://www.torchlightfansite.com/mod_downloads/compilations-tl2/download-555-unearthed-arcana.html) mod.
